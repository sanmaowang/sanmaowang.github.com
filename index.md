## About

Hey, I'm Sanmao. I' m now working as a front-end developer in Beijing, China. This personal site was founded when my career life began. Here you will find my thoughts about web design and web products.

For my job was also related with education, I named this site Lin, which means forest. I believed that trees are symbols of education. I love this word. Since it also comes from my father's name, I wish to dedicate the site to my father.
